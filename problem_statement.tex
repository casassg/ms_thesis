The goal of my thesis is to explore and compare the benefits and limitations of using cloud services to implement disaster analysis infrastructures. After the existing Project EPIC infrastructure went down, it was very important to design and implement a new infrastructure that could be more reliably maintained. The old infrastructure was manually deployed on a set of physical machines in a local data center and was not developed using microservices or containerization. My hypothesis is that I will be able to achieve greater reliability, extensibility, and scalability of a system with a new cloud-first infrastructure with significantly-reduced maintenance costs. I will also explore whether I can improve the ability for teams to work on the infrastructure simultaneously.  My specific research questions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the new infrastructure have lower maintenance costs than the existing infrastructure? 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is it easier to scale? 
        \item Is it easier to extend? 
        \item Is it more resilient to failures? If so, how?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Is it easier to perform parallel development to extend the infrastructure than the previous infrastructure?
\end{enumerate}
